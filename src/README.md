# Kaitai-generated files to read XIA data

The files `pixie4e.py` (python library to read XIA data) and `cpp/*` (c++ code to read XIA data) have been auto-generated by kaita-struct, which uses the XIA data description file `../ksy/pixie4e.ksy`.  

For more information on how the code is generated, see e.g. [Data Readers & Writers](https://github.com/det-lab/dataReaderWriter).

Note that neither the python nor the c++ code is stand-alone; both require kaitai base libraries.  See the top-level README for installation instructions.

## XIA Example Analysis

See `xia_analysis.ipynb` for an example using the python library.  If you are unfamiliar with ipython notebooks, see the top-level README for instructions.
